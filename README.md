> A simple REST API and UI React based for calculating Fibonacci numbers

### How to install and run projects

For the backend REST API click [here](https://github.com/dartheseus/fibonacci-app/tree/master/fibonacci-api#readme) 

For the frontend (React app) click [here](https://github.com/dartheseus/fibonacci-app/tree/master/fibonacci-ui#readme) 

### Considerations

- Both projects use Typescript
- You can get any fibonacci number up to the max value for a number in javascript which is 1.79e308. If you enter a number whose result is greater than that number, the API will return the max value.
- There are examples for unit testing and integration testing in the fibonacci-api app and there is a e2e test within fibonacci-ui app so that you can run npm test on each project and see the results
